# File-Search
Search and listed all Same Extension(.txt, .doc, .java, .php,etc) files, That present any where in hard drive.



I didn't use any api to implement this project just only use recursion function,play with FileIO objects and use Eclipse.

This is most common and usefull project, If you want to listed all same extension files in your laptop or pc. Just change the dot Extension in the code.

Run Index.java
